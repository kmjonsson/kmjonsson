I have constructed a Kawasaki Ki-100 for [aircombat](http://www.aircombat.se).
{% img scale /rc/ki100/640px-Ki-100-RAF-side.jpg "Ki-100" %}

The plans for the model is free and can be downloaded [here](http://drupal.fot.nu/files/Ki100-Combat.zip)

Please read the README.txt before starting to build.

The model has a wingspan of 100cm and a weight of about 700-750g ready to fly.
